    """Parse plain text-based files into paragraph-aware text chunks.

    When ``llm`` is provided, the LLM-based context-aware chunking strategy
    (see :func:`ingestion.context_aware_chunker.chunk_text_context_aware`)
    is used instead of the plain :func:`ingestion.chunker.chunk_text`. This
    is opt-in: without an ``llm``, behavior is unchanged regardless of the
    ``semantic_boundaries``/``contextualize`` flags, since there is no LLM
    to call.

    Args:
        filename (str): Name of the source file.
        content (bytes): Raw file content as bytes.

        llm (LLMClient | None, optional):
            Client used for context-aware chunking. When ``None`` (the
            default), plain paragraph/character-based chunking is used.
            Defaults to ``None``.

        semantic_boundaries (bool, optional):
            Let the LLM choose chunk boundaries based on semantic
            coherence. Only relevant when ``llm`` is provided. Defaults to
            ``True``.

        contextualize (bool, optional):
            Let the LLM prepend a short situating context block to chunks
            that would benefit from one. Only relevant when ``llm`` is
            provided. Defaults to ``True``.

    Returns:
        list[ParsedChunk]: A list of ParsedChunk objects, each with kind='text'.
