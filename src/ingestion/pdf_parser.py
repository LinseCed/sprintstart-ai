    """
    Parse a PDF file into structured text chunks.

    Each PDF page is processed independently. Extracted text is split
    into fixed-size chunks using `chunk_text` (max 512 characters per chunk),
    or, when ``llm`` is provided, using the LLM-based context-aware chunker
    (see :func:`ingestion.context_aware_chunker.chunk_text_context_aware`).

    Each resulting chunk is enriched with PDF-specific metadata.

    Behavior:
        - Each page is processed separately
        - Pages without extractable text are skipped with a warning
        - Each page is split into multiple chunks if needed
        - Each chunk is labeled with kind="pdf"
        - Page-level metadata is attached to each chunk

    Metadata added:
        - page_number: The 1-based index of the PDF page the chunk belongs to
        - chunk_index: Sequential index of the chunk within the current page
        - global_pdf_chunk_index: Sequential global index of the chunk across the
          entire PDF document

    Note on context-aware chunking scope: the LLM is invoked once **per
    page** (not once for the whole document), since pages are already
    processed independently here. This means semantic boundaries and
    context blocks are chosen with only a single page's text in view,
    not the full document — context blocks are therefore page-scoped
    rather than document-scoped. Widening this to whole-document context
    (e.g. by threading a document-level summary into each page's call) is
    a possible future refinement, not implemented here.

    Args:
        filename (str):
            Name of the source PDF file.

        content (bytes):
            Raw binary content of the uploaded PDF file.

        llm (LLMClient | None, optional):
            Client used for context-aware chunking. When ``None`` (the
            default), plain paragraph/character-based chunking is used for
            every page. Defaults to ``None``.

        semantic_boundaries (bool, optional):
            Let the LLM choose chunk boundaries per page based on semantic
            coherence. Only relevant when ``llm`` is provided. Defaults to
            ``False``.

        contextualize (bool, optional):
            Let the LLM prepend a short situating context block to chunks
            that would benefit from one. Only relevant when ``llm`` is
            provided. Defaults to ``False``.

    Returns:
        list[ParsedChunk]:
            A flat list of all extracted and chunked PDF content,
            enriched with page and chunk metadata.
