"""LLM-based context-aware chunking strategy for text content.

This is an opt-in, additive alternative to the paragraph-boundary
``chunk_text`` strategy in :mod:`ingestion.chunker`. Instead of splitting on
character length alone, an LLM is given the full text (split into
paragraphs) and asked to choose semantically coherent chunk boundaries and,
optionally, a short situating "context block" for chunks that would benefit from one.

Both behaviors share a single LLM call but are independently toggleable:

- ``semantic_boundaries``: let the LLM choose paragraph groupings instead of
  the character-length accumulation used by ``chunk_text``.
- ``contextualize``: let the LLM flag chunks that need a short context block
  and prepend it to their content.

If either the text is too large for the LLM, or the LLM output cannot be
parsed, the whole call falls back to :func:`ingestion.chunker.chunk_text`.

The LLM is asked to reason over small integer *indices*, not character
offsets — LLMs are unreliable at counting characters, but reliably reproduce
small integers that are put in front of each segment in the prompt.

Note on ``semantic_boundaries=False``: the caller has already grouped the
text into its final chunks (e.g. via ``chunk_text``'s paragraph-accumulation
logic) *before* calling this module, and passes those finished chunks in as
``segments``. This way the numbering the LLM sees lines up exactly with the
chunk order index that ``context_blocks`` must key off — there is no
separate "boundaries" step to reconcile. When ``semantic_boundaries=True``,
``segments`` are the raw paragraphs instead, and the LLM's own ``boundaries``
determine the resulting chunk grouping (and thus what order index each
chunk has).
