    """Parse a file into structured chunks based on its file extension.

    The parser acts as a dispatcher and forwards the file content
    to the appropriate parser implementation.

    Supported file types:
    - Source code files (see ``CODE_EXTENSIONS``) -> parsed into code chunks
    - PDF files (.pdf) -> extracted text chunk
    - Image files (.png, .jpg, .jpeg, .gif, .webp, .bmp) -> image chunk
    - Any other extension (.txt, .json, .md, ...) -> single plain-text chunk

    There is no "unsupported" type: an unknown extension falls back to the
    plain-text parser rather than raising.

    ``llm``, ``semantic_boundaries``, and ``contextualize`` only affect the
    plain-text and PDF paths (see :func:`ingestion.text_parser.parse_text`
    and :func:`ingestion.pdf_parser.parse_pdf`); code and image parsing are
    unaffected. Passing no ``llm`` preserves the exact prior behavior.

    Args:
        filename (str):  Name of the uploaded file including extension.
        content (bytes): Raw file content as bytes.

        llm (LLMClient | None, optional):
            Client used for context-aware chunking of text/PDF content.
            When ``None`` (the default), plain paragraph/character-based
            chunking is used. Defaults to ``None``.

        semantic_boundaries (bool, optional):
            Let the LLM choose chunk boundaries based on semantic
            coherence. Only relevant when ``llm`` is provided. Defaults to
            ``True``.

        contextualize (bool, optional):
            Let the LLM prepend a short situating context block to chunks
            that would benefit from one. Only relevant when ``llm`` is
            provided. Defaults to ``True``.

    Returns:
        list[ParsedChunk]: A list of ParsedChunk objects extracted from the file.
